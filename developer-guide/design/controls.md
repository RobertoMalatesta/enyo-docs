% UI Controls

    may be open at a time.

    a date

    header inside a panel.

    recommended replacement for the drop-down menu and list box. 

* [Form Checkbox](controls/form-checkbox.html)

    A checkbox used in forms; the user activates it to indicate agreement to
    conditions

* [Header/List Actions](controls/header-list-actions.html)

    A predefined area at the top of a panel, containing the header name, an
    optional subheader, and an area for "list actions"--buttons that enable the
    user to perform actions on the panel's contents

* [Image Grid](controls/image-grid.html)

    A list-based container for displaying images

* [Item/Selectable Item](controls/item-selectable-item.html)

    A focusable Moonstone-styled control that can display simple text.  The
    "Selectable Item" variant adds support for selection state (selected or
    unselected).

* [List](controls/list.html)

    A list may be created by defining a "list item", which is repeated to create
    the list.  When a list's contents overflow, a scroller appears.

* [Panel](controls/panel.html)

    A container that emanates from the right side of the screen.  Panels are

    body content.

    A modal container that may contain controls

* [Progress Bar](controls/progress-bar.html)

    A group of radio buttons.  The user is allowed to choose one (and only one)
    item from among a variety of items.  Selecting one button will release the

    the selection of a view.
